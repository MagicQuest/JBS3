# JBS3  
![JBS "LOGO"](https://github.com/MagicQuest/JBS3/blob/main/jbs3.png?raw=true)

a program made to use C++ without compiling C++

Heavily geared towards drawing to the screen for some reason!

most of the functions are just rips from MSN so if you look at MSN and use the [VSCode extension](https://github.com/MagicQuest/JBS3Extension) you'd probably be good

### What this really is
A JavaScript engine made to run C++/Windows.h functions because sometimes I want to make something in c++  
but I don't have Visual Studio, so the solution -> **JBS3**

### Backstory
I wanted to recreate Visual Basic Script but with JavaScript and thats where JBS came from  

JBS3 is actually only the second version of JBS and I don't remember why the first was called JBS2 but...  

JBS1 actually could have been made with lua (of course it would be called JBS if I did) but i didn't go through with it because I heard about [Luvit](https://luvit.io/) which is basically lua node.js  

JBS2 used Duktape which is a simple JS engine and I had to switch to V8 because it didn't even support ES6!  

JBS3 uses google's V8 engine which was HARD to setup but now im 1 step closer to building chromium!  

speaking of node.js maybe i should just make a node.js library instead

### Examples
In the scripts folder there are a few examples like minesweeper and msnexample while the rest of the scripts folder are completely random tests or funny things I wanted to do
