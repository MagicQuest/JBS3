# JBS3 ![JBS "LOGO"](https://github.com/MagicQuest/JBS3/blob/main/jbs3.png?raw=true)

a program to use C++ without compiling C++

### What this really is
So I wanted to recreate VisualBasicScript but with JavaScript so I think you know where the title came from
JBS3 is actually only the second version of JBS and I don't remember why the first was called JBS2 but...
JBS2 used Duktape which was a simple JS engine but I found out just last week that it didn't even support ES6!
JBS3 uses google's V8 engine which was 6.7/10 hard to setup but now im 1 step closer to building chromium!


Heavily geared towards drawing to the screen for some reason!
