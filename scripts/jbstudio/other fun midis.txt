uhhh i made the "the classic" midi based off this really big clone hero chart (The Boneyard - The Olympian) but specifically (The Boneyard - The Classic)

oh yeah for some reason around tha world 2 sounded weird but there's a tempo change in the original song and idk if i can be bothered to do all that

i made all the midis myself (in fl studio LOL!) besides air-tromb idk where i got that lmao (https://ericjknapp.com/2019/09/26/midi-events/ -> https://ericjknapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/air-tromb-midi.zip)
